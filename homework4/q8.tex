\textbf{(Q8)}

\textit{(a)} True.

\begin{proof}
    From the limit definition of the derivative:
    \begin{align*}
        \ddx \left(f(x) - g(x)\right) & = 
        \displim{x \to a} \frac{\left(f(x) - g(x)\right) - \left(f(a) - g(a)\right)}{x - a}\\
        & = \displim{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a) - g(x) + g(a)}{x - a}\\
        & = \displim{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} + 
        \displim{x \to a} \frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x - a}\\
    \end{align*}

    Therefore, since the limit of $(f - g)$ exists, these limits, which are the derivatives
    of $f$ and $g$, have to exist, and thus $f$ and $g$ are differentiable.
\end{proof}

\textit{(b)} False.

As a counterexample, consider $f(x) = 1$, and $g(x) = |x|$. It follows:
\[
    \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{1}{|x|}
\]

Which is differentiable on its domain. Furthermore, $f$ is differentiable on its domain, but $g$ is not.

\textit{(c)} False.

As a counterexample, consider the function:
\[
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
        0 \text{ if } x \in \Q\\
        1 \text{ if } x \notin \Q\\
    \end{cases}
\]

$f \circ f$ is differentiable, but $f$ is not.

\textit{(d)} True.

\begin{proof}
    Since $f$ is differentiable, this implies $f$ is continuous. Since continuity is
    preserved across composition (provied both functions are continuous), 
    $f \circ f$ is continuous.
\end{proof}
